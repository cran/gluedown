The `gluedown` package helps transition from Râ€™s powerful vectors to
formatted markdown text. The functions use
[`glue()`](https://github.com/tidyverse/glue) to wrap character vectors
in valid markdown syntax. In combination with the
[`knitr`](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) package, this allows users to
directly print R vectors as formatted text for improved clarity and
readability.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kiernann/gluedown")
```

## Usage

The `md_*()` functions are most useful in combination with the
`results='asis'` `knitr` chunk option; this allows users to directly
print formatted text from a code chunk to the body of a document.

``` r
library(gluedown)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

### Lists

Printing vectors as markdown lists was the initial inspiration for the
package.

``` r
inlines <- c(
  md_bold(state.name[1]),
  md_code(state.name[2]),
  md_link(state.name[3], "https://az.gov"),
  md_italic(state.name[4]),
  md_strike(state.name[5])
)

md_bullet(inlines)
```

  - **Alabama**
  - `Alaska`
  - [Arizona](https://az.gov)
  - *Arkansas*
  - ~~California~~

### Pipes

All functions are designed to fit within the tidyverse ecosystem by
working with
[pipes](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html). Chain
together some code and print the results.

``` r
read_html("https://w.wiki/A58") %>% 
  html_node("blockquote") %>% 
  html_text(trim = TRUE) %>% 
  str_remove("\\[(.*)\\]") %>% 
  md_quote()
```

> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect
> Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the
> common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings
> of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish
> this Constitution for the United States of America.

### Extensions

The package primarily uses [GitHub Flavored
Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GFM). With this flavor, some
useful extensions like [task
lists](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-task-lists) are
supported on GitHub. Be mindful of how these results look in your venue
render.

``` r
legislation <- c("Houses passes", "Senate concurs", "President signs")
md_task(legislation, check = 1:2)
```

  - \[x\] Houses passes
  - \[x\] Senate concurs
  - \[ \] President signs

### Inline

You can also use `gluedown` to format R [inline code
results](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-4.html). First, use R to
calculate a result.

``` r
name <- sample(state.name, 1)
abb <- state.abb[match(name, state.name)]
# `r md_bold(name)`
# `r md_italic(abb)`
```

Then you can easily print that result in the middle of regular text with
markdown formatting. In this case, our randomly selected state is
**Louisiana**, which has the abbreviation *LA*.
