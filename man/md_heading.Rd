\title{Markdown ATX headings}
\usage{
md_heading(x, level = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector of heading text.}

\item{level}{A numeric vector of use to determine the number of heading hash
characters to preceed each element of \code{x}. The heading level is equal to
the number of \verb{#} characters in the opening sequence.}
}
\value{
A \code{glue} vector of headings with length equal to \code{x}.
}
\description{
Turn a character vector into a vector of valid markdown ATX headings. These
markdown leaf blocks can be rendered as the \verb{<h1>} through \verb{<h6>} HTML tags.
See \code{\link[=md_setext]{md_setext()}} to create setext (underlined) headings.
}
\details{
An ATX heading consists of a string of characters, parsed as inline content,
between an opening sequence of 1â€“6 unescaped \verb{#} characters and an optional
closing sequence of any number of unescaped \verb{#} characters. The opening
sequence of \verb{#} characters must be followed by a space or by the end of line.
The optional closing sequence of \verb{#}s must be preceded by a space and may be
followed by spaces only. The opening # character may be indented 0-3 spaces.
The raw contents of the heading are stripped of leading and trailing spaces
before being parsed as inline content. The heading level is equal to the
number of \verb{#} characters in the opening sequence.
